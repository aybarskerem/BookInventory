# BookInventory
- A simple Django Rest API project with a simple front-end, drf backend,
  Swagger UI &amp; ReDoc documentation and Docker support.  

## How to run:
- `cd Library`   
- Then, please run `python manage.py migrate` before everything to make sure
migration of the db is complete.  
  
### To run in a local computer without containerization:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`    
- `python manage.py runserver`    

### To run in a Docker container: 
- `docker-compose build`    
- `docker-compose up`    

## Requirements:
- Library/requirements.txt
- Currently only tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Non-API Pages (URLs):
- http://localhost:8000/ to see all the books listed. Then any of the books 
can be clicked on to see its details. This url is also the root page. To list
a book, firstly, books have to be created using [the API pages](#api-pages-(urls):).  
## API Pages (URLs):
- http://localhost:8000/api/schema/ to download the schema in yaml format.  
- http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/ to see a Swagger-UI formatted
documentation.  
- http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/ to see a ReDoc formatted
  documentation.
- http://localhost:8000/api/books to see Django Rest Framework's autogenerated
documentation.
  
Note that, in the API documentation pages, documentations for GET, POST, PATCH,
PUT and DELETE requests for the BookInventory can be seen. Moreover, in 
Swagger UI for example, making a query is quite easy with example formats.    

## Query Functionality:
- To filter the author names including 'tol' and book titles with 'peace' for
example, we can add our query appending a '?' to the root page and doing our 
queries like:  
    - http://localhost:8000?author=tol&title=peace
